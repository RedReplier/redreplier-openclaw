# RedReplier plugin for OpenClaw

Monitor Reddit, Hacker News, X and Bluesky for keyword mentions of your
product, AI-scored 0-100 for relevance so you act on real leads instead of
noise. From inside OpenClaw.

## Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:@redreplier/openclaw-plugin
openclaw plugins enable redreplier
openclaw gateway restart
```

Create a dedicated, revocable token at
[redreplier.com](https://redreplier.com) under Settings, then API Tokens.

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      redreplier: {
        enabled: true,
        config: { apiToken: "redreplier_..." }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The token decides the account, so you never pass an account or group id.

## Tools

| tool | what it does |
|---|---|
| `redreplier_websites` | List monitored websites with their keywords and statuses. Call this first. |
| `redreplier_mentions` | List AI-scored mentions, filtered by site, status, score, keyword, source or date. |
| `redreplier_explain_mention` | Read why one mention scored the way it did. |
| `redreplier_set_mention_status` | Approve, reject, or reset a mention. |
| `redreplier_add_keywords` | Add keywords to a website. |

Five tools out of the API's twenty, and the omissions are deliberate.

## What is deliberately missing

Nothing here can spend your money. `POST /keywords/activate-pending` promotes
what fits your plan and then charges a real upgrade to cover the rest, so it
stays out of the plugin along with the billing preview endpoints. Same for
deleting a website or a keyword. Run those yourself, or reach them through the
[MCP server](https://github.com/RedReplier/redreplier-mcp), where the
confirmation rules are spelled out.

`redreplier_add_keywords` is the one write that touches keywords, and it is
safe by construction: new keywords land as PENDING, anything that fits the
current plan is promoted for free, and the rest sit inert until someone
activates them by hand.

## Things worth knowing

Two filters hide rows by default. `redreplier_mentions` excludes REJECTED
mentions, and hides anything scoring under 30 unless you pass
`includeLowRelevance`. A query that "returns nothing" is often one of those.

Only ACTIVE keywords match new mentions. PENDING ones match nothing, so a
website with a long pending list looks quiet for reasons that have nothing to
do with the internet.

`redreplier_explain_mention` generates the explanation on first call and
consumes AI quota. Use it on a score that looks wrong, not across a list.

The API allows 600 requests per minute per token. A 429 comes back with
`Retry-After` and the plugin surfaces it rather than hammering.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run build
openclaw plugins install --link . --force --accept-capabilities
openclaw plugins inspect redreplier --runtime --json
```

Needs Node `>=22.22.3 <23 || >=24.15.0 <25 || >=25.9.0`. `npm install` runs
OpenClaw's version guard on postinstall and stops outside that range.
